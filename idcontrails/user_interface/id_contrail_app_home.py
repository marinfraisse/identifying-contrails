st.header("What does it have to do with global warming?")
st.write("Contrails contribute to global warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere. They block heat that normally is released from the earth overnight.  You can consider them as temporary greenhouse clouds that retain heat in the atmosphere. The issue is that with constant air traffic, this temporary effect becomes almost permanent, with huge environmental impact!")
st.write("Contrary to general belief, emissions from burning kerosene do not constitute the bulk of aviation's emissions. Persistent contrails contribute as much to global warming as the fuel that is burnt for flights! After years of research it is now well accepted that contrails contribute approximately 1% of all human caused global warming.")

st.write("Contrail avoidance is potentially one of the most scalable, cost-effective sustainability solutions available to airlines today.")
st.write("Researchers have developed models to predict when contrails will form and how much warming they will cause. However, they need to validate these models with satellite imagery. With reliable verification, pilots can have confidence in the models and the airline industry can have a trusted way to measure successful contrail avoidance.")
st.write("The endgame is to have models sufficiently reliable to empower and incetivize airlines to adapt their routes based on each flights risk to generate contrails, based on weather conditions.")
